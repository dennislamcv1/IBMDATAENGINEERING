## IBM Data Engineering Professional Certificate

### About this Professional Certificate

This Professional Certificate is for anyone who wants to develop job-ready skills, tools, and a portfolio for an entry-level data engineer position. Throughout the self-paced online courses, you will immerse yourself in the role of a data engineer and acquire the essential skills you need to work with a range of tools and databases to design, deploy, and manage structured and unstructured data.  

By the end of this Professional Certificate, you will be able to explain and perform the key tasks required in a data engineering role. You will use the Python programming language and Linux/UNIX shell scripts to extract, transform and load (ETL) data. You will work with Relational Databases (RDBMS) and query data using SQL statements. You will use NoSQL databases and unstructured data.  You will be introduced to Big Data and work with Big Data engines like Hadoop and Spark.  You will gain experience with creating Data Warehouses and utilize Business Intelligence tools to analyze and extract insights.   

Each course includes numerous hands-on labs & projects to apply the concepts and skills you learn. The program will culminate in a Capstone Project where you will bring together all of these skills to develop and implement an entire data platform with various data repositories and pipelines to address a real-world inspired data analytics problem. 

This program does not require any prior data engineering, or programming experience.  

### Applied Learning Project

Throughout this Professional Certificate, you will complete hands-on labs and projects to help you gain practical experience with Python, SQL, Relational Databases, NoSQL Databases, Apache Spark, building a data pipeline, managing a database and working with data in a data warehouse.

In the final course in this Professional Certificate, you will complete a Capstone Project that applies what you have learned to a real-world inspired scenario that requires you to design, deploy and manage an end-to-end data engineering platform consisting of various Relational (Transactional Data Warehousing), NoSQL & Big Data repositories as well as data piplelines to connect them.
